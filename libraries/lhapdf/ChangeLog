Changelog for LHAPDF
--------------------
v4r2 - 14/11/2005
* Addition of new cteq6AB (variable alphas(mz)) PDF sets.
* Mods by cteq to other cteq code to improve speed.
* New a02m_nnlo.LHgrid file (previous one was erroneously the same as LO).
* Fix to SMRSPI code which was wrongly setting usea to zero.	

v4r1p1 - 19/9/2005
* Patch to fix bug affecting cteq6(LHgrid) at x>0.9763

v4r1:
* Converted build system to use GNU autotools
* Introduced path-independent references to PDF sets via the lhapdf-config
  script and the InitPDFsetByName subroutine. Note that the script must be
  in the user execution path and must have been installed by autotools to 
  work properly.
	
v4r0:
* The addition of PDF sets for photons and pions
* Additions to lhaglue including STRUCTP for photons and PDFSTA for statistics
* More PDF sets included.
* A new simpler directory structure

v3r0:
* The addition of the routines PDFSET and STRUCTM plus a unique PDF numbering 
  scheme (all from the lhaglue package) to enable the LHAPDF to be used in the 
  same way as PDFLIB.
* More PDF sets included.

v2r0:
* Single compilation of code for ALL PDF sets. (In v1 the user had to recompile 
  the code when using different evolution code packages)
* Ability to use the original interpolation grid files (.LHgrid) produced by 
  the authors of the PDFs, as well as parameter files (.LHpdf) to define the 
  PDFs with seamless switching between the two types.
* More PDF sets included.
