2.4.4 (4/10/2015) - fix a bug preventing pythia to run on e+ e- colision with systematics on.

2.4.3 (17/01/15) - fix some compilation problem on Debian

2.4.2 (14/01/15) - pass to pythia 6.4.28

2.4.1 (26/11/14) - better support for the switching to cteq6l1 if the pdf set is not supported

2.4.0 (04/07/14) - Support for LHEFv3 format
                 - support for switching to cteq6l1 if the pdf set is not supported by this package 

2.3.0 (22/04/14) Support for stdhep file with size larger than 4 Go. External tools might not support the new format.

2.2.1 (21/02/14) Fix a compilation issue on some linux

2.2.0  (16/12/13) Read and store information needed for systematics
       studies. Read more in the file Template/README.systematics
       - Allow for mixed number of matching jets in processes, as needed
       e.g. in p p > w+ b b~ + jets.

2.1.26 (29/11/13) Fix the stdhep which was creating corrupted file when the 
       size of the file was more than 4Gb (more than 50k events at lhe level)

2.1.25 (25/11/13) Fix some makefile which was making some linux to crash

2.1.24 (22/11/13) Fix a problem a conversion of unit in the hep->lhe 
       converter

2.1.23 (21/11/13) Forbid pythia to assign pdg to zero if the particle
        pdg is unknown/too large.

2.1.22 (27/08/13) Fixed the slha reader of pythia for MODSEL allowed to 
       float format for the integer.

2.1.21 (22/03/13) Fixed the reading of etaj from the run_card when it 
       is set to -1 (only affects matched processes).

2.1.20 (16/01/13) make the reading of the run_card case insensitive

2.1.19 (13/11/12) Increased the size of the character string reading
       PDG_MASS_TBL in STDHEP to allow long directory names.

2.1.18 (08/11/12) Fixed the STDHEP-Pythia interface so cross section is
       stored in pb instead of mb.
       Temporary fix for tau polarization in tauola (to be confirmed by
       John Conway).

2.1.17 (22/06/12) Upgraded to latest version of PGS (120611). 
       Let PYINIT take care of reading the param_card.
       Fixed minor issue with 4-flavor matching.

2.1.16 (04/02/12) Pass writing file in append in order to have this
       version working with MG5 1.4.

2.1.15 (24/01/12) Upgrade Pythia to v. 6.426.
       Lift out the "-lSystemStubs" from some makefiles to make_opts
       (so it is easy to add/remove it as needed for different OS X 
       versions).

2.1.14 (29/11/11) Ensure that also LHAPDF uses the Fortran compiler
       set in src/make_opts.

2.1.13 (17/11/11) Move FC and -m32/64 definition to separate file
       src/make_opts, to allow easy setting once for all makefiles.
       Rename lhapdflib to lhapdfliblocal to avoid that
       the systemwide version of lhapdf is used during the compilation
       time.

2.1.12 - fix one makefile, which was not allowing the FC specification

2.1.11 (06/10/11) PGS is now 10 times faster! (thanks to Junichi)

2.1.10 (03/10/11) Allow for state-of-the-art matching of processes
       with t-channel singlet exchange (e.g. VBF and single top).
       Don't count scattered partons (connecting to the t-channel
       singlet) as jet particles in the matching (just as b quarks are
       not counted in 4F matching since v. 2.1.9), but afterwards
       check that FSR from these lines don't give too hard radiation.
       Note that this requires to use MadGraph 5 v. 1.3.18 or later.
       - Change the makefile to allow to use gfortran by setting the 
       environment variable FC

2.1.9  (24/09/11) Automatically set number of jet flavors based on 
       MadEvent run_card, and set MSTJ(45) accordingly.
       Don't count final-state radiation from heavy quarks (to allow
       4-flavor matching where the b counts as heavy).

2.1.8  (20/05/11) Changed output of events.tree for new reading routines.
       Removed some unnecessary code.

2.1.7  (11/05/11) Updated Pythia package to 6.425.
       Put pydata.o directly in compilation, to avoid linking problem for 
       certain compilers.

2.1.6  (17/03/11) Implemented new feature to allow using color sextets:
       Specify REMRES=PDG in the pythia_card.dat (for up to 30 PDG codes)
       to remove these resonances from any event before showered by Pythia.

2.1.5  (21/01/11) Fixed stdhep makefiles to work with Mac OS X.

2.1.4  (03/03/10) Updated Pythia package to 6.4.22.

2.1.3  (09/12/09) Avoid Pythia writeout if failed hadronization.
       Fixed bug in PGS with stable charged particles.
       Removed superfluous warning printout from tauola.

2.1.2  (20/08/09) Fixed BRSUPP for multiple processes (thanks Matt Reece
       for pointing this out)

2.1.1  (30/07/09) Add support for "showerkt" matching with both kt schemes
       available in MG/ME v. 4.4.25

2.1.0  (08/06/09) Updated PGS to latest version and Pythia to 6.4.20.
       Ensure compatibility with gfortran.
       Allow for ckkw matching (ickkw=2).

2.0.27 (01/03/09) Fixed bug in e+e- processes, so that resonances are 
       correctly treated also in this case.

2.0.26 (10/07/08) Changed behaviour in matching routine, so that now
       also radiation from resonances is taken into account in
       jet matching. Radiation from decay products is not included,
       corresponding to decay being done after addition of matrix
       element jets.

2.0.25 (11/04/08) Added matching options in the pythia_card.dat for 
       multiple process files:
       IEXCPROC(PRID)=OPTION
         PRID is process number found after the @ in the proc_card.dat
           or in the event file.
         OPTION is -1 for unmatched process, 0 for inclusive (highest 
           multiplicity) process, 1 for exclusive process.
           If no option=0 are given and highest mult. process not 
           specified, standard treatment is used (according to IEXCFILE)
           for unspecified processes.
           If option=0 for at least one process, unspecified processes
           are treated as option=1.

2.0.24 (01/04/08) Removed adjustment of incoming heavy quark masses,
       to let Pythia take care of that instead.

2.0.23 (14/03/08) Added new matching options:
       logical nosingrad:   If true, treat pairs of partons forming color 
          singlets as coming from a colorless resonance (i.e. remove 
          from jet listing) even if the resonance is not in the 
          event listing.
       logical showerkt (def. false): If true, use the "shower kt" 
          matching method (only for case with xqcut>0) 
          otherwise use standard kt cone (now both for new and old shower).
       integer nqmatch (def. 5): Choose highest parton id being matched 
          (should be set to 4 for bb~+jet matching)
       double etcjet: Minimum jet et in the cone jet matching algorithm. 
          Set by default to max(ptj*1.2,ptj+5).

2.0.22 (04/03/08) Increased number of parameters allowed in run_card
       to 1000
       Moved common block initializations in ME2pythia.f to a block data.

       (thanks to Erkcan Ozcan!)

       add new particles
       Added parameters MINJETS and MAXJETS in the pythia_card for 
       running matching on partial sample
       Added possibility to exclude events with given resonances for 
       running matching using EXCRES=pdg number in pythia_card
       Fixed problem with total cross section for matched processes

2.0.18 (27/9/07) Removed default PARP(67)=1d0 statement in pythia.f
       Commented out new matching scheme for pt-ordered showers (now
       using standard MLM matching)
       Improved b-tagging and other issues in the hep2lhe converter

2.0.17 (12/9/07) Fixed bug where Z boson cross section was not reduced
       due to closed decay channels

       use of UPVETO also for pt-ordered showers)
       Inclusion of new matching scheme for pt-ordered showers.  
       Remove superfluous z/gamma resonance for e+e- collisions.

2.0.12 (9/5/07) Removed stable flag for pi's to fix tau reco in PGS

      creation of Root readable tree files with events and cross
      sections

-- Passing to version 2 with the merging of the matching version with --
