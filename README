To set Fortran compiler, and Mac OS X version specific flags:
-------------------------------------------------------------
Edit the file src/make_opts.
Note that this is done automatically if run from within the mg5 interface
using "install pythia-pgs".
Please see the file README.macosx for troubleshooting.

To run Pythia on an event file:
-------------------------------
Please note that if there is a pythia_card.dat and the pythia-pgs
package is installed in the default location (see item 1 below),
pythia will be run automatically when you generate events with MadEvent.

1) Make sure the pythia-pgs package is unpacked in the MG_ME_v4.x.x
   directory

2) Do "make" in the pythia-pgs/ directory

3) Go to the MyProcDir  directory and run 
   ./bin/madevent pythia RUNNAME
   and follow instructions

To run PGS on a STDHEP file:
----------------------------

Follow the steps above, with "pythia" replaced by "pgs"
